# approach 1

get all the data from req.body (from frontend) to mongoDb and then process that data 

route.post('/userDetails',-------


successfull response 

{
    "nickName": "Disco",
    "questions": {
        "struggleTime": "9 weeks",
        "bedTime": 2,
        "wakeUpTime": 19,
        "sleepHours": 5
    },
    "_id": "62ee143dfd5992043e61b25a",
    "__v": 0
}



# approach 2 

post-->put-->put -->put 

post data nickName 
then put all the question on null 

then update one by one by endPoints


route.post('/nickName,---)

router.put('/struggleTime',----)

router.put('bedTime',-----)

router.put('/sleepHours',--------)

they all are linked with the same uniqueID ("62ee03602acc2e9092a50245")
send again and again from diff endpoints Via Header token or simple body Token



2) verifying user is in middleWare section 



1)  {
    "nickName": "divine",
    "questions": {
        "struggleTime": null,
        "bedTime": null,
        "wakeUpTime": null,
        "sleepHours": null
    },
    "_id": "62ee7d3722bbeac27d8c30cf",
    "__v": 0
}


after 4 updates 

{
    "_id": "62ee86c2f0f8664bde3265b8",
    "nickName": "divine",
    "questions": {
        "struggleTime": "2 weeks",
        "bedTime": "10",
        "wakeUpTime": "6",
        "sleepHours": "6"
    },
    "__v": 0
}
